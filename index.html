          <h3>Early Fascination</h3>
            <p>As a child, I loved building and painting model planes.</p>
            <p>I remember my father taking me to the 2009 Paris Le Bourget Air Show, when I saw the A380 flying I couldn't believe that something this big could fly, it felt almost magical.</p>
            <p>Thanks to my parents, I had the chance to go on a plane modeling summer camp and flew a glider in the Pyrenees during this summer camp — that flight sealed my passion for aviation.</p>

          <h3>Brevet de Base and PPL</h3>
          <p>Wanting to start flying I started my PPL training in 2012.
            <br/>I started training in Chelles next to Paris (LFPH). The plane I started to fly on was the Rallye 110
            <br/> I first got the now removed Brevet de Base at 15 years old, this license made it possible to fly within 30 km around your base aerodrome and was a french only license.
            <br/>During the next part of the training I switched to the Evektor SportStar and I finally obtained my PPL at 17 years old.

          <h3>University</h3>
          <p>
            In September 2016, I joined an integrated preparatory programme for Engineering Studies at the Université de Troyes (UTT).
            I started a Bachelor's degree in <b>Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</b> at the Institut Universitaire de Technologie de Troyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last semester was done as an Erasmus Exchange within the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of Vysoká škola báňská, Technical University of Ostrava in the Czech Republic
            I had the chance to work with international students from all over Europe in group projects.
            This experience made me realise that I like working in a <b>multicultural</b> and <b>english-speaking environment</b>

          <h3>Engineering School</h3>
          <p>
             In September 2020, I joined an engineering school in Paris, l'Ecole Française d'Electronique et d'Informatique.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an apprentice, I was both working as a Software Engineer (3 days a week) and attending classes (2 days a week).
          </p>
          <p>
            Passionate about aviation, I chose THALES as a company, working on military IFF Products, for famous planes such as the Dassault Rafale, SAAB Gripen and Airbus A330 MRTT.
          </p>
          <p>
            To validate my degree, I had to spend at least 3 months abroad.
            I had found an internship in Donauwörth in Germany, where a very famous helicopter manufacturer is located, but my internship was cancelled at the last minute and I hade to find a solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            I chose to do a volunteering experience in Indonesia and Sri Lanka instead of an internship.

          <h3>Volunteering in Indonesia</h3>
          <p>
            As part of an organisation, I spent 3 weeks in Tianjar, Indonesia. I collaborated with international volunteers (mainly British) and Balinese locals.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sea floors are destroyed by overfishing in Indonesia, our mission was to help restore the coral population in the nearby beaches, in close collaboration with locals.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was done by mixing cement with water to make concrete, dig into the ground to make molds,
             pour the concrete inside the molds. Once the concrete structures were dry, our job was to dig them out of the ground, carry them to fishermen boats, and throw them out at sea.
            We could also dive to arrange the structures into bigger ones underwater.
          </p>
          <p>
            The impact of this method was clearly positive, as structures from previous years were full of coral and fish and turtle population were coming back to feed.

          <h3>Volunteering in Sri Lanka</h3>
          <p>
            As part of an organisation, I spent 2 months and 1 week in Hikkaduwa, Sri Lanka. I collaborated with international volunteers (mainly British) and Sri Lankan locals.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Sri Lanka, plastic pollution of the shore is a big problem, and sea turtles and their eggs are poached. Our mission was to clean the sea shore, find turtle eggs and care for them until hatching and release on the beach. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Every few nights we had to patrol the beach to try to find turtles laying eggs. If we found some eggs, we had to bring them to a protected hatchery. During the day, we mainly cleaned the beaches.
            There was also opportunities to give children lessons, either english lessons, sports or swimming lessons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our impact was meaningful, as we ensured the safe release into the sea of hundreds if not thousands of turtles during my stay there.
